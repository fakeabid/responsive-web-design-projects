      <p id="tribute-info">Admiral Yi Sun-sin (1545–1598) was a legendary Korean naval commander during the late Joseon Dynasty. He is best known for his brilliant naval strategies and the decisive role he played in defending Korea against Japanese invasions (1592–1598), also known as the Imjin War.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Invented the "Turtle Ship" (Geobukseon): One of the world's first ironclad warships, designed to counter the Japanese navy.</li>
        <li>Never lost a battle: Despite being heavily outnumbered in many conflicts, he won every naval battle he fought.</li>
        <li>Battle of Myeongnyang (1597): With just 12 Korean ships, he defeated 330 Japanese warships, one of the greatest naval victories in history.</li>
